Interpreter translates just one statement of the program at a time into machine code.
Compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into machine code at once.
An interpreter takes very less time to analyze the source code. 
However, the overall time to execute the process is much slower.

Python is used as an interpreted language and not a compiled one,
Although compilation is a step. 
Python code, written in . py file is first compiled to what is called bytecode.

PYTHONPATH is an environment variable which we can set to add additional directories where python will look for modules and packages.
For most installations, we should not set these variables since they are not needed for Python to run.
Python knows where to find its standard library.

input:-

s = '   abd cde   '
s.strip()

output:-
'abd cde'

.strip() function removes both leading(start) and trailing(end) white space charecters.
But , lstrip() function removes only the leading(start) white space charecter.
& , rstrip() function removes only the trailing(end) white space charecter.
